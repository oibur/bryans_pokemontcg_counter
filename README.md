Bryan McGills
Python project for Code Louisville 2021

1) Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits
2) Project includes a README file that explains the following:
    a) A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
    b) Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements
    c) Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run your project
3) Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project

Features List:
1) Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program
2) Create a class, then create at least one object of that class and populate it with data. The value of at least one object must be used somewhere in your code
3) Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
4) Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
5) Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application
6) Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
7) Implement a regular expression (regex) to ensure a field either a phone number or an email address is always stored and displayed in the same format
8) Connect to an external/3rd party API and read data into your app
9) Create 3 or more unit tests for your application
10) Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it (ex: converts cups to grams)
11) Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex: get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event)
12) Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)
13) Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data
14) Implement a “scraper” that can be fed a type of file or URL and pull information off of it. For example, a web scraper that lets you provide any website URL and it will find certain keywords on the page
15) Implement optical character recognition (OCR) that you can upload PDFs to and it will generate the text 
16) Use pandas, matplotlib, and/or numpy to perform a data analysis project. Ingest 2 or more pieces of data, analyze that data in some manner, and display a new result to a graph, chart, or other display
